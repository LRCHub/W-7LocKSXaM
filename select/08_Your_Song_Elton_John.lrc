[00:08.74] It's a little bit funny
[00:12.54] This feeling inside
[00:16.22] I'm not one of those who can easily hide
[00:23.67] I don't have much money, but boy if I did
[00:30.68] I'd buy a big house where we both could live
[00:52.68] 
[00:40.30] If I was a sculptor, ha
[00:44.54] But then again, no
[00:46.80] Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
[00:54.57] I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
[01:02.76] My gift is my song, and this one's for you
[01:23.76] 
[01:11.87] And you can tell everybody
[01:15.97] This is your song
[01:19.63] It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
[01:27.20] I hope you don't mind
[01:29.13] I hope you don't mind
[01:31.00] That I put down in the words
[01:35.62] How wonderful life is while you're in the world
[01:59.12] 
[01:53.73] I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
[01:59.94] Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
[02:08.15] But the sun's been quite kind
[02:12.11] While I wrote this song
[02:15.66] It's for people like you that keep it turned on
[02:39.16] 
[02:25.08] So excuse me forgetting
[02:29.06] But these things I do
[02:32.89] You see I've forgotten, if they're green or they're blue
[02:39.87] Anyway the thing is, what I really mean
[02:47.95] Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
[03:08.95] 
[02:56.98] And you can tell everybody
[03:01.34] This is the song
[03:04.82] It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
[03:11.82] I hope you don't mind
[03:14.28] I hope you don't mind
[03:15.87] That I put down in the words
[03:20.74] How wonderful life is while you're in the world
[03:44.24] 
[03:30.96] I hope you don't mind
[03:32.85] I hope you don't mind
[03:34.94] That I put down in the words
[03:39.50] How wonderful life is while you're in the world
